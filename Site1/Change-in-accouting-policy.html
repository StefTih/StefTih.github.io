			<br>The change in accounting policies is required if:
			<br>
			<br>•	It is required by the statute
			<br>•	It results into a better and appropriate presentation
			<br>•	The change will provide more useful, relevant and reliable information of financial statements about the effects of transactions, events, financial performance, etc
			<br>•	When there is a change in accounting policy, the company has to disclose the following facts:
			<br>•	Disclose the changes that would have a material effect in this period or upcoming periods
			<br>•	In case of the material effect of the change in this period, calculate and disclose the amount by which any item in the books of account is affected by such change

			<br>1. Nature of change
			<br>2. Reasons for change
			<br>Where the retrospective application is impracticable, the reasons for such impracticability.
			<br>If change is due to a new standard, transitional provisions should be applied. If transitional provisions are not given, the new policy should be applied retrospectively. This standard state that the significant accounting policies adopted by the company should form part of the financial statements.

			  <br> <b>How Do I Account For Cash Dividends? (Explained)</b>
			  <br>
			  <br> <b> Retain earnings</b>
			  <br>
			  <br> Dividends represent the distribution of resources to shareholders. Usually, these resources include cash or stock that a company pays from its profits. At the end of each accounting period, companies decide how much dividends to pay to their shareholders. Usually, this process occurs annually. In some cases, however, companies may also pay quarterly or ad-hoc dividends.
			  <br>
			  <br> For investors, dividends represent a type of return they can get from a company’s shares. This return comes from a company’s profits or retained earnings. Most companies prefer to receive dividends through cash payments. Some companies also get share dividends. The accounting for cash dividends also differs from stock. In essence, the accounting process is the same. However, both cash and stock dividends are not similar.
			  <br>
			  <br> What are Cash Dividends?
			  <br>
			  <br> A cash dividend is a type of distribution from profits made from a company’s cash reserves. When a company makes profits, it may decide to distribute these profits among shareholders. The primary form of these distributions is cash dividends. For companies to pay these dividends, it is crucial to have a cash reserve to accommodate payments to shareholders.
			  <br> 
			  <br> Cash dividends relate to several factors. Usually, the higher the profits a company makes, the more dividends it will distribute among shareholders. Companies also have a retention ratio that dictates how much profits they will retain before making distributions. In the case of cash dividends, the company’s cash reserves will also play a crucial role in the payments.
			  <br>
			  <br> Due to the accrual concept in accounting, the profits that companies make do not represent cash inflows. Therefore, the cash dividends that companies will make will not come directly from their profits. Usually, the cash and cash equivalent balances that companies have will impact these payments. Unlike stock dividends, companies cannot distribute these dividends from their equity reserves.
			  <br>
			  <br> Overall, cash dividends are the distribution of profits from cash reserves. When companies distribute these dividends, they need cash reserves. Any shareholder that holds the company’s shares at the record date will get these dividends. Usually, companies make cash dividends through bank transfers or cash payments to shareholders.

			<br> <b> What is the difference between Cash Dividends and Stock Dividends?</b>
			<br>
			<br> The primary difference between cash and stock dividends is the resources that companies use to pay them. When a company reports profits, it has the option to pay cash dividends or stock dividends. Usually, companies choose the former due to how common they are. In some cases, companies may also select to go with stock dividends.
			<br>
			<br> Most shareholders prefer to receive cash dividends. Since these dividends come in monetary form, it gets transferred to the shareholder’s account directly. In the case of stocks, the transfer is also direct. However, shareholders do not receive cash. Instead, they obtain stocks. For shareholders who want the former, a sale transaction will be necessary. In other words, stock dividends are less liquid in comparison to cash dividends.
			<br>
			<br> Companies usually choose to pay stock dividends when their cash reserves get depleted. When companies don’t have enough cash reserves, they may decide not to pay dividends at all. However, when they want to distribute dividends regardless, they must go with stock dividends. Usually, companies choose a ratio that dictates how many shares each shareholder will get depending on their existing holding.
			<br>
			<br> In essence, both cash and stock dividends are the same. However, the cash dividends paid to shareholders deplete a company’s cash reserves. With stock, the same does not apply. Instead, it impacts its share reserves. Companies make stock dividends through the issuance of new shares. In some cases, it can also affect share price due to the additional share capital.
			<br>
			<br> Overall, both cash and stock dividends represent a distribution of resources to a company’s shareholders. However, cash reserves are direct payments through its cash reserves. With stock dividends, the share capital and other reserve accounts get impacted. In most cases, cash dividends are a regular distribution of profits, while stock dividends are more ad hoc.
